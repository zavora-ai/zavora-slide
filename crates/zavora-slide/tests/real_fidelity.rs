//! What a slide drawn from a real deck contains.

//! Opening a presentation used to keep the slide's XML for editing and, for drawing, gather every

//! slide whose content was a picture drew as nothing, and no shape had the colour or the position
//! the file gave it. These hold the shape tree being read instead.
